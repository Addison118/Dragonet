Dragonet
========

The universal Minecraft server, supports both MC PC and MC PE clients. 

##Is this fully working now?
I am sorry, but we are trying our best to implement everything that Minecraft has. 

##Download
You may download pre-compiled binaries at our website:
[http://dl.dragonet.org](http://dl.dragonet.org)<br>
`Notice: ` Binaries in that folder are OUTDATED and they are based on the old CraftBukkit. <br>
If you want to get the brand new Dragonet, you may want to compile the source code yourself.
