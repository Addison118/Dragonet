##Is this fully working now?
Yes, mostly! But you may expirence some bugs and issues because this software is still in heavy development stage. 

##Where do I grab the GUI version?
Right now, The Dragonet Team is working on a GUI wrapper for the server, it will be released when we are done with 0.0.2!

##Where is the Dragonet GitHub Wiki?

##So what's the deal with the Android app?
We have an android app in development! However it is not for creating a server. @RandomAltThing will also be making a separate app to host the server on your device!
